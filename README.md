# Volatility Surface Model

Volatility surfaces help traders visualize the market's sentiment on how much a ticker is going to move in the future.
In the Black-Scholes-Merton model of options pricing, the implied volatility (IV) of a stock for all of its given options should be a single value. However, in real life, several assumptions needed to use the BSM do not hold.
